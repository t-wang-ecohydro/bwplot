The goal of bwplot is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("t-wang-ecohydro/bwplot")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(bwplot)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

# bwplot [![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This repository contains files for `bwplot`, an R package for producing `ggplot` graphs with a tidier default theme. 

This package is under construction as part of UBC's STAT 545B course for the Winter 2020 semester.
