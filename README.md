## `bwplot` repository

This repository contains files for `bwplot`, an R package for producing `ggplot` graphs with a tidier default theme. 

This package is under construction as part of UBC's STAT 545B course for the Winter 2020 semester.

Currently available plotting functions are:
1. `bw_mean_col`: produces a `geom_col()` plot with the following defaults:
  - Background: 'theme_bw()`
  - Gridlines: none
  - Legend: none
  - Fill: unique color per column
  - Axis labels: default data table column names
